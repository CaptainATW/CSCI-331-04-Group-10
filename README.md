# Traffic Sign Detection System
We are building a Traffic Sign Detection System using computer vision + machine learning

**Objectives:**
* Create system that takes images of streets with vehicles and detects traffic signs in them
* Build full Machine learning pipeline (data prep, model training, evaluation, and analysis)
* Compare two different image segmentation models (U-Net vs Mask R-CNN)

## How It's Made:

**Data used:** 
**Tech used:** Python, Google Colab,
